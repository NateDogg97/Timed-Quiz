# Timed-Quiz
Challenge 04 AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

I first created an outline for the quiz in HTML. I left most of the elements blank and used javascript to populate them as the user navigates through the quiz. 

However, I spent so much time getting the javascript code to work that I ended up creating a separate javascript file to handle the functionality of the highscores page. 

The intention was to merge the two script.js files to complete the assignment.

Unfortunately, I was spending too much time on this assignment and had to turn it in to start on the next assignment.

I chose to create functions for each question that would populate the HTML page on the fly as the user navigates through the quiz. I never ended up completing the conditional statements to determine the score since I was confident I knew how to create that functionality.

I chose to spend my time building the parts of the site that I didn't know how to complete to maximize the learning I was doing with this challenge. 

I have attached two copies of each type of file; 2 HTML, 2 CSS, and 2 Javascript files. The files labeled with a 2 are the files I used to create the functionality of the high scores page.

I especially had trouble with the time / score-counter. I could get the timer to work properly on the first run through the quiz, but if the user clicks the return button to restart the quiz and try again, the timer would break.

I also had trouble storing each user to local storage to recall it when the higscores page was populated. I figured this part out, although I never really understood why it was ever broken at all.

Lastly, I could never successfully merge the codes to creat a single working page.
